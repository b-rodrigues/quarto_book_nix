# Building on Github Actions with Nix

## Setup

Just like when building using the usual approches, you first need to build the book
locally, on your computer, once. For this, after having generated the `default.nix`
file, you can build the environment using `nix-build`, and then drop in a shell
with `nix-shell` (if this previous sentence is confusing, make sure you read the 
vignette linked at the end of the previous chapter).

Once in that shell, run `quarto publish gh-pages`. This will render the book, and make
sure that everything gets setup properly. If the book does not render, this could mean
that you're missing some dependency. Make sure to specify all the requirements
in the `define_env.R` script and that you re-generated the `default.nix` file. If 
the `quarto publish gh-pages` command succeeds, you're all set. Editing the book and
pushing will build the book on Github Actions.
